                suppose if i start from jar 3, 
                and blue color came out
                so, either it'll be 
                           1. B+P   ❌ (but it cant be b+p cause everything here is mislabelled)
                           2. Blue

        then i'll come at this jar
        it can either be 
        1. pink
        2. b+p  
        cause i already got my blue jar
