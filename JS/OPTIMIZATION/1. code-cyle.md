 ___Step1 : PARSING:___
tokenisation hota h yahaaa
tokens mein convert hota hai programm ... 


1. eager : Oh! parse all function, all ! EVRYTHING !! 
2. lazy : oh this is a func. let it be there, later when it'll be called, then i'll parse it

OPTMISE.js helps in optimising our code
Also we can test our code at : 
https://nolanlawson.github.io/test-optimize-js/
<br><br>


 ___Step2 : AST (abstract syntax tree):___
since we already parsed,now it turned into Abstract syntax tree.


<br>

 ___Step3 : Optimising compiler ( TURBO Fan):___
 before code moves to interpreter(IGNITION) and turns into bytecode, WE WANT IT TO go through TURBO-FAN, so that it gets more optimised.

 `run benchmarks.js` 
 learn how to check performance of a function execution.

 then check how if its went to turbofan or not.

 **Note : deleting is much slower 
 (about 50%) than making it undefined.**
