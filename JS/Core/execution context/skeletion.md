#### CONCEPT 1 :
###### Everything in JS happens in EXECUTION CONTEXT



Q: Arey bhai ?
what does <b>`execution contexts`</b> even means ?

ANS : 

    -----------------------------------
    | Memory         |             Code |
    -----------------------------------
    |Key                           value|
    |                                   |          
    -------------------------------------

it basically has <b>`two main components`</b> inside it.
1. Memory creation phase (aka `variable env`)
2. Code execution phase (aka `thread of execution`. its just like a thread, where whole code is executed ONE LINE AT A TIME)
